<a name="intro"><h1> Introduction </h1></a>
<h3> What is PPJoy? </h3>

PPJoy is a joystick device driver for Windows 2000 and later. It no longer supports for Windows
98 and Windows Me. PPJoy was originally designed for joysticks connected to the parallel port but
it also supports other devices via the virtual joystick interface<p>

Supported devices are:
<ul>
 <li> Digital joysticks for the Commodore 64, Atari, ZX Spectrum and other computers of that era.
 <li> Playstation controllers.
 <li> NES, SNES and Virtual Gameboy controllers
 <li> Sega Genesis controllers
 <li> PPM and PIC interface Radio Control transmitters
 <li> Joystick emulation using the keyboard or mouse
</ul>
<p>

Windows will treat these devices just like any other joystick and they can be used in any game or
application that accepts joystick input.<p>

<h3> Why PPJoy? </h3>

There are lots of USB joysticks out there that are a lot less hassle to install and configure. So here is why
you may want to use PPJoy:
<ul>
 <li> PPJoy is free for non-commercial use and you may already have a perfectly good controller supported
      by PPJoy. A small donation will however be appreciated.
 <li> Use the original controllers along with an emulator for a more authentic experience.
 <li> Use your all-time favourite controller with PC games.
 <li> Use PPJoy instead of a keyboard encoder in a game cabinet.
 <li> You want to emulate joystick input from another application.
</ul>
On the other hand you still need to buy or build the proper adapter to connect your controller to your computer.


<a name="supportedos"><h1> Supported Operating Systems </h1></a>

PPJoy was designed for Windows 2000, Windows XP and later. PPJoy now also supports 64 bit versions of
Windows - but there is a catch. Vista x64 and later requires signed drivers. The PPJoy drivers are only
test signed, with requires the operation system to run in Test Mode. To can enable this by running:

<pre>
  BCDEDIT -SET TESTSIGNING ON
</pre>

from an administrative command prompt. I will set up a fund for donations towards buying a proper kernel mode signing
certificate as soon as I can find a PayPal (can't receive money via PayPal in South Africa).
<p>
<b>There is (always) a small risk that PPJoy may crash or bluescreen your computer. Use it at
your own risk.</b>
<p>
Windows NT 4 or Windows 95, 98 and ME is not supported.

<a name="upgrading"><h1> Upgrading from an older version </h1></a>

When upgrading from version 0.83 or earlier please uninstall the old version first.

Otherwise you can install a new version of PPJoy over an older version without uninstalling
it first.

<p>
PPJoy v0.81 changes the default mapping of playstation controllers. The [],/\,O and X buttons are
now mapped to the POV hat by default rather than to fire buttons.
<p>
PPJoy v0.78 changes the definition (and order) of axes for the PPM R/C and virtual joystick (IOCTL)
devices to better accommodate Windows 98/Me and non-DirectX joystick applications. You must delete
device or interface mappings you created in previous versions of PPJoy to take advantage of this
change.
<p>
PPJoy v0.75 has undergone major internal changes. If you are upgrading from an earlier version
your old joystick definitions will be deleted as part of the installation process. You will need
to add the joysticks again after the install is finished. Also, for Windows 98/Me you need to add
the Joystick Bus again (see <a href="UserManual/PostInstall98.htm">Additional installation steps
for Windows 98 and Me</a>).


<a name="future"><h1> Planned features </h1></a>

The following are a list of thing that I hope to get around to (if and when time permits):
<ul>
 <li>Optimised scan routines that scan many joysticks in parallel.
 <li>Force feedback for playstation controllers.
 <li>DualShock2 analog buttons support.
 <li>Better documentation / tutorials.
 <li>Integration into the "Game Controllers" Control Panel applet.
 <li>Visual Basic 6 and Delphi sample code for IOCTL (virtual joystick) interface.
 <li>Dead-zone and sensitivity configuration.
</ul>

It is unlikely however that any of these features will be implemented as I have decided to suspend PPJoy development.

<a name="note"><h1> A personal note </h1></a>

<strike>
I have decided to stop PPJoy development.<p>

Why? Firstly I can no longer afford to spend the many hours and days it takes to develop
PPJoy and maintain the documentation.<p>

Secondly, people on the Internet today seem to be an ungrateful bunch. I have received
about 5 postcards and 4 donations. And thank-you emails have been few and far between...
Hardly worth the effort I put into PPJoy! Instead I get emails mindlessly asking questions
already answered in the manual.<p>

Will there be a next version of PPJoy? I don't know. Probably not any time soon. And if
there is a new version is will no longer be free. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.
</strike>
<p>
Thank you to everybody who made the effort to track me down (on facebook and other places)
and sent me thank you notes.
